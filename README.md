# PokeDex
An App using PokeAPI to display a list Pokemon and relevant information about each one.

I am using MVVM and Android Architecture Components,
Navigation Component from Jetpack for navigating from Activity to fragments,
along with coroutines for implementing service calls.
Written in Kotlin.
Using Retrofit for APIClient.

I initially used the pokeKotlin Wrapper library for service calls, then rewrote them using Retrofit.
Mockito is used in unit tests;
